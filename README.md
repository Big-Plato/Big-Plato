<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to my Github Profile</h1>

My name is Luis Octávio, and I'm a graduate of Philosophy. I really love philosophy, but I love technology and programming more. 
When I was fifteen, I was dreaming about computer science or other courses that had something to do with programming. But life has taken me in another direction; I've had to work on other things to live on when I was eighteen. Twelve years later, I'm coming back to this area to become a programmer. 
With my graduation in philosophy, I learned a very crucial thing: if I want to reach a goal, e.g., if I want to become a programmer—in my case—all I need to do is become focused and persevere. Studying, practicing, and creating things that will help people to achieve their goals too.
