<h1>Luis Octávio</h1>


Welcome to my GitHub profile, I have thirty years old and live in Rio de Janeiro. I'm a graduate of Philosophy. I really love philosophy, but I love technology and **programming** more. 
When I was fifteen, I was dreaming about computer science or other courses that had something to do with programming. But life has taken me in another direction; I've had to work on other things to live on when I was eighteen. Twelve years later, I'm coming back to this area to become a **programmer**. 
With my graduation in philosophy, I learned a very crucial thing: if I want to reach a goal, e.g., if I want to become a programmer—in my case—all I need to do is become focused and persevere. Studying, practicing, and creating things that will help people to achieve their goals too.
